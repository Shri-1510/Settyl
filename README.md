# Machine Learning Model Deployment with FastAPI

This project demonstrates how to train a machine learning model(SVM in this case), save it to a file, and deploy it using FastAPI for serving predictions through a REST API.

## Files

- `model_building.py`: This script contains the code for training the machine learning model (Support Vector Machine - SVM) using data from `dataset.json`. It preprocesses the data, builds the SVM model, evaluates its performance, and saves both the trained model (`svm_model.pkl`) and the label encoder (`label_encoder.pkl`) to files.

- `app.py`: This script sets up a FastAPI application to serve predictions using the trained SVM model and label encoder. It loads the model and label encoder from the files generated by `model_building.py` and exposes an API endpoint `/predict` to receive external status as input and return the predicted internal status.

## Dependencies

- `pandas`: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- `scikit-learn`: For building the SVM model and preprocessing data.
- `fastapi`: For creating the REST API.
- `uvicorn`: For running the FastAPI application.

You can install the dependencies using the following command:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`


## Usage

1. **Training the Model**: Run the `model_building.py` script to train the SVM model and save it along with the label encoder to files.

    ```
    python model_building.py
    ```

2. **Starting the FastAPI Server**: Run the `app.py` script to start the FastAPI server.

    ```
    uvicorn app:app --reload
    ```

3. **Making Predictions**: Use the `/predict` endpoint of the FastAPI server to make predictions. You can send a GET request with the external status as a query parameter.

    Example:
    ```
    GET http://localhost:8000/predict?external_status=some_external_status
    ```

    Replace `some_external_status` with the external status for which you want to predict the internal status.

## Notes

- Ensure that `dataset.json` contains the required data for training the model and that it follows the expected format.
- It's recommended to perform error handling and input validation in a production environment.
- This README assumes that you're running the scripts locally. For deployment to a production environment, you may need to make adjustments accordingly.
